    description: "Early-onset Alzheimer's disease can be inherited within families if there is a mutation in the PSEN1 gene. Inheriting this mutation from just one parent is enough for the disease to develop. Mutations in the genes cause an excess of harmful protein — beta-amyloid. This protein accumulates in the brain and leads to the death of nerve cells. Alzheimer's is a brain disease that gradually robs memory, thinking ability, and everyday functioning. Over time, changes in personality, anxiety, withdrawal, and speech difficulties may also occur. In later stages, patients require constant care."
